# Stuff To Do

- [ ] Put the citation for the wiwa shapefiles into 04.R and also cite them correctly in the paper.
- [ ] Make sure 03 runs and clean up a lot of the stuff that doesn't seem to need to be there.
- [ ] Get all the intermediates figured out for 04.  This will probably involve putting some of the bigger ones onto Dropbox or, better yet, on Dryad. And make sure that 04 runs (but don't bother with regenerating the base map, etc).
- [ ] Note in the README that I don't have the random number seed needed to regenerate our exact geneland results.
- [ ] Figure out how to cite Natural Earth data and cite them in the paper.
- [ ] Once I am able to make sure that it is all running again, I should use packrat to make sure the packages are all versioned.
- [ ] Put the settings file for the WIWA pipeline run into this repository and write about how to get the pipeline to run it.
- [ ] Permute the colors correctly for the map.
- [ ] Test for the presence of the big netcdf files.  If they are there, then don't re-download them!
